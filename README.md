## About The Project

![Screen Shot](https://github.com/dimov05/Property-Manager/blob/main/screenshots/screenshot-home-screen.jpg)

This web application provides a solution for building managers and homeowners. The idea behind this project is to make house manager's jobs easier and to help them make building management more transparent to the owners of properties in the building.

Here's how:
* The house manager can monitor and update the data for all buildings in which he is a house manager:
-- Adding all the data for a building - apartments and their owners, periodic taxes ( tax per person, dog, or elevator chip) and etc.
-- Adding/Paying Expenses - more info available in Documentation soon.
-- Paying/Returning Taxes - more info available in Documentation soon.
-- Adding/Editing Messages
-- Tracking information about neighbours taxes
* Every user can keep track of every building in which he has a property:
-- Check the property Dashboard
-- Adding/Editing Messages
-- Tracking information about the building's expenses
-- Paying and tracking information about his Taxes

How this web application works and more instructions will soon be available in the project Documentation.
